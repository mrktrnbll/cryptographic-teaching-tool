# Evaluation of Tool Effectiveness

## Education Professional Focus Group

Semi-structured interview with 3 staff members at Auchenharvie Academy - 18/02/2025.

**General:**
- How was your overall experience using the 3D tool?
- How would you rate the *content* you were exposed to when using the 3D tool?
- Was the *content* well organised and delivered in a digestable way?
- Was 3D tool meet your expectations?
- Was the *learning objectives* of the tool clearly stated and achievable?

User experience form. - [link to form](https://forms.office.com/e/ryAWPea0hx)

**Application For Students**
- What is your current experience teaching this type of content to pupils?
    - expand on strath clyde stuff
- Does the school and teaching staff currently use any "non-generic" teaching methods - how do these workout?

- How useful do you believe this will be for students in a class room over convential teaching method?
    - Engagement
    - Knowledge Retainment
- How does rotor settings defintion compare to plugboard?
    - One is very 3D based, other not so much.
- Do you think students will learn better from the navigation and naration feature?
    - Could this be changed to better facilitate learning?

**If this was pilot study**
- Key issues identified:
    - 1    
    - 2




## Experimental Design


**Two groups experimental groups: (>15 <=30 particapants each)**
- First group use novel visualisation tool
- Second group use more convential teaching material - video lecture with accompanying slideshow. (to be created)

### Evaluating the experiment.
The experiment will have only first year unviersity students - this is to as closely as possible mimic the knowledge and understanding of highschoolers. (do i have them act under personas???)

Both the experimental and control group will carry out their task and then fill out the same feedback form, as well a small knowledge consoldation test that aims to measure the amount of knowledge retained from using the mode of learning.


### Form

**General:**
- How was your overall experience using the 3D tool?
- How would you rate the *content* you were exposed to when using the 3D tool?
- Was the *content* well organised and delivered in a digestable way?
- Was 3D tool meet your expectations?
- Was the *learning objectives* of the tool clearly stated and achievable?

**Usability:** - **important to ensure no loss of *resolution* between design and implementation stages of project.**

Plan is to use System Usability Scale (SUS) to evaluate the usability of the software. [SUS Questionaire](https://blog.uxtweak.com/system-usability-scale/).


**Engagement:**
- How engaging did you find the 3D enigma?
- Would you use a similar tool/software to learn other cryptography topics?
- What improvements do you think could be made to make the tool more engaging?

**Plan to add more, if some aren't relevant to answering my question that is okay because I don't know what I don't know yet, the questionaire answers will inform what parts are exciting to talk about**


### Knowledge Test
1. Name the three section of the engima machine has for encrypting and decrypting an input?
    - Answer: Switchboard, Rotors, Reflector
2. What section of the engima machine was the main point of insecurity that made letters unable to encrypt to itself?
    - Answer: Relector
3. Further describe why this section of the engima machine caused letters to be unable to encrypt into itself.
    - Answer: The reflector was a static mapping of 13 letters to another 13 letters (caesor cipher). This allowed code breakers to know when there key was wrong if the plain text ever mapped the same letter to the cipher text.
4. Explain how the rotor system works to ensure that there is never a recurring pattern when inputting the same letter into the enigma machine.
    - Answer: The rotors mechanically turn on each letter input. The right most rotor rotates one position changing its substitution cipher setup. Once the right most completes an entire cycle of 26 turns, it will cause the rotor to turn by one step which changes its own substitution cipher setup. For a enigma machine with three rotors this means it takes 26 * 26 key presses for the rotor in second position to make one whole cycle. Furthermore, 26 * 26 * 26 for the rotor in postion 3 to perform one whole turn.
    - **extra points for realising that their is a recurring pattern and that it is just combitionally large - not covered by either 3D tool or micro lecture**
5. In the context of the engima machine what is a private key?
    - Answer: The sheet that decribes switchboard, and rotor configuration for performing encryption and decryption.

Add more as needed.
